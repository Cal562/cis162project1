		<h1>Douglas Rodriguez Calderon</h1>
		<p>I'm Doug, I grew up in LA and I enjoy learning computer science. I would like to pursue a career in computer science. I enjoy working and being busy although sometimes it can really catch up to me. I think building webpages is really cool because it's a unique form of art a person can express for themselves that everyone can see on the net. I first started learning web design from youtube and freecodecamp but I feel like I need a push to understand it more.</p>
		<h1>My hobbies</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>1. I like to ride my motorcycle around town</li>
			<li>2. Working to keep myself busy</li>
			<li>3. Cleaning</li>
		</ul>
		<p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> because there are so many funny videos and there's also a bunch of stuff you can learn on it.</p>
