		<p>I'm Doug, I grew up in LA and I enjoy learning computer science. I would like to pursue a career in computer science. I enjoy working and being busy although sometimes it can really catch up to me. I think building webpages is really cool because it's a unique form of art a person can express for themselves that everyone can see on the net. I first started learning web design from youtube and freecodecamp but I feel like I need a push to understand it more.</p>
